# Music Recommendation Model with Various Classifiers

Welcome to the Music Recommendation Model repository! This project explores the implementation and comparison of different classifiers, along with ensemble combinations to build a robust music recommendation system.

## Overview

The goal of this project is to create an advanced music recommendation model by leveraging a diverse set of classifiers and exploring ensemble methods. The classifiers include Random Forest, SVM, CatBoost, Gradient Boosting, XGBoost, and k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN). By combining these classifiers using ensemble methods, we aim to achieve the highest accuracy in music recommendations.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/your-username/music-recommendation-model.git
    cd music-recommendation-model
    ```

2. Install the required dependencies for each classifier:

    - **Random Forest:**
      ```bash
      pip install scikit-learn
      ```

    - **Support Vector Machines (SVM):**
      ```bash
      pip install scikit-learn
      ```

    - **CatBoost:**
      ```bash
      pip install catboost
      ```

    - **Gradient Boosting:**
      ```bash
      pip install scikit-learn
      ```

    - **XGBoost:**
      ```bash
      pip install xgboost
      ```

    - **k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN):**
      ```bash
      pip install scikit-learn
      ```

    <!-- Add any additional libraries needed for specific classifiers -->

3. Install other necessary libraries:

    ```bash
    # Add any additional libraries needed for data preparation and model evaluation
    ```

4. Optional: Create a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

    Then proceed with steps 2 and 3 within the virtual environment.

## Usage
...


1. Prepare your dataset: Ensure that you have a dataset containing relevant features for music recommendation.

2. Configure your dataset: Update the configuration files to specify the input features, target labels, and other relevant settings.

3. Train the classifiers: Run the provided scripts to train individual classifiers or ensemble models.

4. Evaluate the models: Assess the performance of each model using appropriate metrics.
